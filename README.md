Different equipmentâ€™s are used to test the insulation of electrical machines and measure the break down voltages of 
different materials, e.g. Rogowski Profile, Borda Profile and fluke insulation tester. These testing techniques works on a 
common principle of applying a very high voltage across the insulating material and keep increasing the voltage which 
increases the electric field until the breakdown voltage is reached where the insulation breaks down. Different materials 
are tested via insulation testers to determine their breakdown voltages so that the corresponding correct materials are used 
accordingly in different situations. Devices with higher impurities causes sparks and arcing, so dielectrics having 
higher breakdowns should be used as their insulation, otherwise, a suitable dielectric should be used. This paper 
offers a novel method to overcome the above-mentioned problems using an insulation testing device that should be 
automated, less bulky, less expensive, portable and which shall be easy to use with higher degree of safety.
